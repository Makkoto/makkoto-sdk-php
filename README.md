# makkoto-sdk-php

Makkoto SDK in PHP.

This repository provides two things:

 1. **Client** - A tiny wrapper around the Guzzle HTTP Client to interface
    directly with the Makkoto BaaS. This is great for building highly customised
    applications.
 2. **Widgets** - A series of embeddable widgets to immediately power your web
    application.

Note that widgets are not yet available.
